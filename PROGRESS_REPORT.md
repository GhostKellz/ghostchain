## 🧱 Architecture Overview

We are transitioning to a **Zig-first architecture** for the Ghostchain ecosystem.

### ✅ Current State

| Component         | Language | Status                     | Notes                                                  |
|------------------|----------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `ghostchain`     | Rust     | ✅ Functional               | Rust-based core L1 chain, planning Zig rewrite         |
| `ghostd`         | Rust     | ✅ Running                  | Daemon / node service, tightly coupled to Rust chain   |
| `walletd`        | Rust     | ✅ Running                  | Wallet + signing daemon                                |
| `zvm` / `zevm`   | Zig      | ✅ Functional               | WASM + smart contract execution layer (pure Zig)       |
| `shroud`         | Zig      | 🚧 In Development           | Zero-trust crypto + network stack                      |
| `ghostbridge`    | Zig/Rust | ✅ Working via FFI          | gRPC + FFI bridge to Rust tooling                      |
| `ghostctl`       | Zig      | 🧪 Experimental             | CLI tools + identity handling (GID, Auth)              |

---

## 🕸️ Long-Term Plan

| Goal                                | Strategy                                                      |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| ✅ Pure Zig L1 blockchain            | Rebuild Ghostchain node in Zig using `shroud` + `keystone`    |
| ✅ Native QUIC/HTTP3 networking      | Use `ghostwire` for node communication (QUIC, IPv6, DoH, etc) |
| ✅ Smart contract VM in Zig          | Continue improving `zvm` runtime                              |
| ✅ Cryptographic stack in Zig        | Fully migrate to `ghostcipher` (was `zcrypto`, `zsig`)        |
| ✅ Zero-trust identity and DNS       | `sigil`, `zns`, `shadowcraft`, and `guardian` modules         |
| 🔁 Rust for optional L2 or zk stuff  | Rollups, zkEVMs, or bridges can remain Rust-based             |
| ❌ Legacy TCP/NAT/central infra      | Ghostchain will natively run over IPv6+QUIC on public internet|

---

## 🔄 Migration Plan

1. **Archive** Rust `ghostchain`, `walletd`, `ghostd` after full Zig chain parity
2. **Replace** `zledger` with `keystone` in Zig
3. **Embed** `ghostwire` as the native transport (QUIC-first)
4. **Unify** networking + crypto under `shroud` (QUIC, HTTP3, DNS, TLS, Crypto)
5. **Use** `ghostbridge` for FFI/gRPC where needed during transition
6. **Optional**: Maintain Rust-based zk/L2 tooling if beneficial

---

## 🔧 Immediate TODO

- [ ] ⏩ Finalize `shroud` module interfaces (ghostwire, ghostcipher, keystone)
- [ ] 🚀 Bootstrap pure Zig Ghostchain L1 prototype
- [ ] 🛠️ Refactor `zvm` to support full smart contract API
- [ ] 🔁 Refactor any remaining Zig <-> Rust bridge points
- [ ] 🧪 Build full Zig testnet node running over QUIC (ipv6 only)
- [ ] 🧱 Use `sigil` for auth and key resolution in `ghostctl`
- [ ] 📦 Add ENS + Unstoppable support to `zns`

---

## 📌 Notes

- The Zig ecosystem now supports QUIC, HTTP3, and TLS (see `quiche`, `zquic`, `mach`).
- Shroud aims to be the "GhostStack" for Web5: identity, crypto, networking, trust.
- Keeping Rust in the loop for zk/L2 allows long-term flexibility.

---

## 🔚 Summary

We're evolving Ghostchain into a **Zig-native Web5 infrastructure protocol**:
- QUIC/IPv6-first
- Zero-trust native
- DNS + Identity aware
- High-performance and zero-legacy

Everything else is legacy.
