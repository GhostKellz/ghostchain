# GhostNet: The Programmable Internet Infrastructure

## 🚀 Project Codename: GhostNet

> *The convergence of Web2 reliability and Web3 programmability.*

---

### 🌐 Vision

GhostNet aims to bridge today's internet with tomorrow's decentralized technologies. It transforms every device—your laptop, phone, server, or router—into a secure, contributive node in a privacy-first programmable internet. GhostNet empowers identity, trust, and payment at the network layer.

No extensions. No wallets. No passwords.
Just programmable identity, encrypted infrastructure, and native economic incentives for the open internet.

### 🧱 Core Pillars

#### 1. **GhostMesh VPN + Network Fabric**

* QUIC + WireGuard hybrid overlay network
* STUN/TURN/ICE fallback with IPv6 priority
* Signed peering via GhostID (Ed25519/PQC)
* Optional bandwidth + relay tokenization (Proof of Contribution)

#### 2. **GhostVault: Identity + Asset Container**

* Secure device-based vault for identity, secrets, and crypto assets
* Hardware-aware (TPM, Secure Enclave, HSM)
* Local keygen, transaction signing, delegated permissions
* Interfaces with system APIs (NGINX, SSH, Docker, etc.)

#### 3. **GhostChain** (Layer 1.5 hybrid ledger)

* Lightning-fast POS/POC blockchain with zk-rollup support
* Supports GCC (Ghost Chain Credits) + RLUSD (via Ripple integration)
* Oracle bridges for Ethereum, Stellar, XRP, HBAR
* Native DNS, certificate, and identity resolution via smart contracts

#### 4. **Programmable Infrastructure Agents**

* Zig-based GhostNodes for low-footprint compute, mesh routing
* Rust-based `ghostctl` and `ghostd` for full-node and CLI management
* Integrates with Docker, Proxmox, Kubernetes, and systemd
* Web2 services (e.g., websites, APIs) powered and verified via Web3

---

### 💡 Real-World Use Cases

* Securely expose self-hosted services via mesh VPN with payment proof
* Replace login forms with GhostID + zkProofs
* Incentivize bandwidth and compute via Proof of Contribution
* Use RLUSD or GCC to pay for AI inference, hosting, or content access
* Sync your identity across the web using ENS-compatible names
* Access your GhostVault on any device with biometrics + passkey

### 📦 Ghostnet Modules

* `ghostctl` — CLI for managing identity, networking, vaults
* `ghostvault` — Device-bound wallet + key agent
* `ghostmesh` — Secure mesh VPN + bandwidth accounting
* `ghostchain` — Rust-based blockchain with zk-identity
* `ghostdns` — DNS + ENS bridge service
* `ghostid` — Identity generation + zk-auth framework
* `ghostnode` — Zig-powered agent for routing + proof generation

---

### 🧠 Research + Innovation Areas

* zk-proofs for relay/bandwidth contribution
* Biometric-linked GhostID auth
* Encrypted DNS/QUIC-based resolution
* zkMail, zkDomains, DNSSEC-on-chain integration
* Wallet-less tokenization of hardware and devices
* Smart Contract NGINX plugins
* Crypto micropayments for AI/LLM inference access

---

### 🔐 Privacy and Security First

* No global telemetry or forced centralization
* All keys stay local unless exported/signed by user
* Anonymous contribution possible via ZK rollups
* GhostVaults never leak metadata unless explicitly signed

---

### 📜 License

MIT for core tools, dual licensing (AGPLv3 + commercial) for runtime and chain logic.

---

### 📍 Next Steps for You

* Start building in Rust or Zig
* Learn QUIC, WireGuard, and DNS internals
* Fork and extend `ghostctl` for system automation
* Prototype `ghostvault` and secure key storage
* Join the mesh, test relay proofs, and explore programmable micro-payments

### 🔮 The Future

GhostNet isn’t a product.
It’s a platform.
It’s your OS for programmable trust.
It’s the foundation of GhostChain.
And it starts now.
