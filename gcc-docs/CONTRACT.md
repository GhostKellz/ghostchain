# CONTRACT.md ‚Äî Smart Contract System for GhostNet

## üîß Purpose

GhostNet smart contracts go beyond traditional DeFi and token transfers. They are programmable, auditable components that anchor identity, access control, tokenization, automation, and data integrity across the network.

GhostNet introduces:

* **Real-world asset tokenization** (RWAT)
* **Digital-native contract workflows**
* **cDNS-integrated identity enforcement**
* **Event-driven automation for dApps and systems**

---

## ‚ú® Core Innovations

### 1. **Programmable Infrastructure Contracts**

Smart contracts can automate tasks on:

* Proxmox nodes
* DNS + TLS record management
* VPN tunnels and mesh overlays
* System-level actions (via GhostMesh + GhostAgent)

### 2. **Digital & Physical Asset Tokenization**

Tokenize:

* Domains (via cDNS)
* Servers, VMs, containers
* Licenses, keys, credentials
* Physical assets (IoT, property, etc.)

Each token has a linked **cDNS-backed identity** and can hold metadata, access control policies, and economic logic.

### 3. **Smart Contract Engine Design**

* Written in **Rust**, WebAssembly-based runtime (WASM)
* gRPC over QUIC API for contract execution
* Event-driven model: triggers from mesh events, DNS changes, payments
* Version-controlled with `contract.toml` schemas

### 4. **Secure Storage and Auditing**

* Immutable state changes
* Every contract is traceable and hash-logged
* Integrated with **GhostVault** for zero-trust secrets and agent signing

### 5. **RLUSD Integration for Payments + Staking**

* Stablecoin-native execution layer
* Contracts can trigger RLUSD transfers, pay bounties, or enforce staking conditions

## üåê Contract Use Cases

### ‚úÖ Identity

* Assign GhostID (Soulbound RLID)
* Validate identities on blockchain + GhostMesh

### üöÄ Automation

* Setup your own validator node
* Auto-configure Proxmox + VPN + DNS

### ‚õè Tokenization

* RWAs and digital assets, tracked via smart contracts

### ‚öñÔ∏è Commerce + Agreements

* P2P payments
* Time-based access to servers, APIs, or apps
* Contract-signed proof of service or hosting

## ‚öõÔ∏è Contract Platform Layers

| Layer          | Purpose                               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| gRPC + QUIC    | Secure interaction layer              |
| WASM Runtime   | Deterministic execution               |
| Rust Contracts | Safe, auditable source code           |
| GhostVault     | Stores private keys, agent signatures |
| RLUSD Token    | Native payments and staking           |

## üîí Privacy, Trust, and Recovery

* Contracts do not require user secrets
* Recovery via GhostVault + RLID backups
* Optional on-chain and off-chain computation balance
* Anonymous, signed interactions with zero-knowledge options later

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

* Build `ghostcli contract` tooling
* Launch starter templates for tokenization, automation, governance
* Enable AI-assisted contract generation (Jarvis integration)
* Launch testnet contract registry

Smart contracts on GhostNet are not just transactions.
They are **living infrastructure** components for the next generation of programmable internet, commerce, and cryptographic identity.
