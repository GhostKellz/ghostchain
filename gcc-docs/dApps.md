# DAPPS.md ‚Äî Decentralized Applications on GhostChain

## üîç Overview

Decentralized Applications (dApps) on GhostChain extend traditional web apps with cryptographic trust, distributed infrastructure, and programmable ownership. Built using QUIC/gRPC APIs and deployed via GhostNet nodes, dApps on GhostChain leverage modern internet standards (IPv6, HTTP/3, DNSSEC) while supporting Web3-native constructs.

---

## üîß Core Technologies

* **gRPC over QUIC**: Replaces REST for high-speed, typed communication
* **HTTP/3 Web Frontends**: Native support for wallets, dashboards, and smart UIs
* **GhostID Integration**: Identity-aware dApps via RLID, QID, or federated auth
* **Smart Contracts**: Managed via `CONTRACT.md` logic (tokenization, automation)
* **GhostMesh & Vault**: Secure encrypted storage and peer mesh for real-time sync

---

## üì¶ Key Use Cases

* **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**: Lending, yield farming, stablecoins (RLUSD)
* **Content Publishing**: Ghost-powered blogs, token-gated media, paywalls
* **E-Commerce**: Peer-to-peer payments with instant settlement
* **Voting & Governance**: Token or identity-based ballots with audit trails
* **Infrastructure dApps**: Deploy/manage Proxmox, DNS, or server agents securely
* **AI Integration**: Agents powered by Jarvis, auto-triggering infra or trading logic

---

## üîê Security & Privacy

* **Zero Trust Sandboxing**
* **End-to-End Encrypted Channels (QUIC+TLS1.3)**
* **Auditability via signed GhostChain transactions**
* **User-side validation of contracts before execution**

---

## üß† Developer SDK

* Written in Rust (primary) and optionally Zig for plugins
* SDK exposes:

  * Smart contract deployment helpers
  * gRPC APIs over QUIC
  * GhostID integration primitives
  * Static site + dynamic state hybrid model

---

## üß™ Example dApp Flows

1. **Deploy a Smart Contract**: Use CLI or dashboard to push to GhostChain
2. **Serve dApp UI**: HTTP/3 static + JS-powered client (with GhostID login)
3. **gRPC Interactions**: Typed contract calls, token transfers, off-chain ops
4. **P2P Sync**: Updates reflected via mesh oracles, real-time streaming

---

## üåê Interoperability

* ENS + DNSSEC for name resolution
* Works via regular browsers (no plugin required)
* Tunnels securely over GhostMesh when on private or restricted networks

---

## Future Goals

* Template library for dApps (e.g., eCommerce, chat, voting)
* Integration with GhostVault encrypted data layer
* AI-coordinated dApp workflows via Jarvis agents
* cDNS for contract resolution & routing

---

## Summary

GhostChain dApps redefine the web by combining blockchain logic, smart identity, and encrypted mesh networks over QUIC. With developer-first tooling and real-world interoperability, they pave the way for Web5: secure, fast, decentralized, and user-owned.
