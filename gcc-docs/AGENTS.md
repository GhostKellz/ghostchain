# GhostNet Agents & Auditable Infrastructure

## Overview

GhostNet Agents are autonomous, verifiable, and incentivized AI or system processes that run within the GhostNet ecosystem. Each agent monitors, audits, or performs a service that contributes to the network. Their activity is signed, optionally ZK-verified, and submitted to GhostChain for reward.

---

## 1. Agent Lifecycle

### 1.1 Deployment

Agents are deployed via the `ghostctl` CLI:

```sh
ghostctl agent deploy <agent-name> --reward=gcc --cap=net_admin
```

### 1.2 Identity

Each agent has a GhostID (or RLID/QID) issued from GhostVault.

### 1.3 Isolation

Agents may run:

* In isolated containers (Docker, Podman)
* Inside eBPF, WASI, or Secure VM sandboxes
* On trusted nodes with GhostVault signatures

---

## 2. Agent Tasks

* Log analysis
* Health checks (nginx, zfs, btrfs, uptime, load)
* Security scans (CrowdSec, Wazuh integration)
* LLM summaries or remediation suggestions
* Webhook triggers and smart contract updates
* Data offloading (to GhostVault, IPFS, or S3)

---

## 3. Proof of Contribution (PoC)

### 3.1 Insight Submission

Each agent regularly submits a signed insight to GhostChain:

```json
{
  "agent_id": "ghostid:alice@ghostvault",
  "summary": "nginx TLS valid, uptime 99.8%",
  "hash": "0xabc123...",
  "timestamp": 1730494800,
  "reward_claim": true
}
```

### 3.2 zk-SNARK or Rollup

* For large insights or sensitive data, ZK-proofs are used
* Proofs may be batched and posted as rollups to GhostChain

---

## 4. Reward Model

### 4.1 Metrics

Rewards (GCC / RLUSD) are calculated based on:

* Frequency of submission
* Insight value (security, uptime, infra audits)
* Resource class (bandwidth, CPU, memory, disk)
* Uptime and identity reputation

### 4.2 Auditing

* On-chain audit trail
* Validator agents verify reports
* Malicious reports can be slashed and GhostIDs revoked

---

## 5. Agent Registry & Marketplace

* Agents are discoverable via GhostNet Agent Registry (GAR)
* Registry supports:

  * Rating
  * Audit history
  * Metadata (category, permissions, language)

Example:

```sh
#ghostctl is just a placeholder
ghostctl agent search --category=security
```

---

## 6. Integration With GhostChain

Agents may:

* Push metrics to smart contracts
* Trigger DNS record updates
* Modify TLS policies
* Act as on-chain oracles

---

## 7. Future Expansion

* Agent SDK (Rust/Zig)
* Monetizable inference APIs
* LLM-based agents that fine-tune based on host behavior
* GhostMesh discovery of agent nodes

---

## Summary

GhostNet Agents enable a new layer of decentralized infrastructure monitoring, secure telemetry, and reward-based autonomous services. They form the AI-powered backbone of GhostChainâ€™s Proof-of-Contribution and make the next generation of infrastructure programmable, secure, and economically incentivized.
