# QNGP.md — QUIC Next Generation Proxy / Web Server

## 🚀 Overview

QNGP (QUIC Next Generation Proxy) is a secure, high-performance replacement for NGINX tailored for the modern internet. Designed with QUIC, HTTP/3, gRPC, and blockchain-first use cases in mind, it redefines web hosting and dApp serving for a decentralized, ultra-low-latency Web5.

Built in Rust or Zig for maximum efficiency and safety, QNGP is not just a proxy or reverse proxy — it's the backbone of hosting WordPress, GhostCMS, smart contract APIs, blockchain node communication, and identity layers like GhostID.

## 🔧 Core Features

* ⚡ Built-in QUIC & HTTP/3 support — no need for external modules
* 🔐 TLS 1.3 native with GhostDNS and certless mutual auth via GhostID/QID
* 🌐 Web2/Web3 hybrid: Traditional websites, smart contracts, and dApps on the same server
* 📦 Static & dynamic site hosting (WordPress, GhostCMS, Hugo, etc.)
* 🧠 Native gRPC and WebSocket routing for LLMs and blockchain contracts
* 🔁 Blockchain Transaction Handler Middleware
* 🛰 Smart Load Balancing & Caching for node APIs
* 🌲 Logging + tracing hooks with AI-aware metrics

---

## 💡 Use Cases

* Host WordPress or Ghost-based sites via HTTP/3 with QUIC transport
* Serve GhostChain dApps, wallet interfaces, and dashboards
* Manage smart contract interactions over gRPC
* Proxy traffic between public and private node mesh endpoints
* Authenticate users via GhostID and auto-configure SSL via GhostDNS
* Reverse proxy OpenLLM, Ollama, Claude Code backends for Jarvis AI

## 🧱 Architecture

| Layer           | Protocol       | Purpose                                 |
| --------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| L7 Proxy Engine | QNGP Core      | Routing, TLS termination, caching       |
| App Proxy Layer | gRPC / HTTP/3  | Blockchain, AI, CMS APIs                |
| Transport Layer | QUIC           | Low-latency, secure stream multiplexing |
| Network Tunnel  | WireGuard+QUIC | GhostMesh integration, peer discovery   |

---

## 🔄 Extensibility

* Plugin-based architecture for adding:

  * dApp routing rules
  * CMS installers (WordPress, Ghost)
  * Smart contract introspection
  * GhostVault signing gateways
* GitOps support: Host static sites directly from repo commits
* Supports ACME and GhostDNS cert provisioning (DNS-01/QUIC)

---

## 📈 Performance Goals

* Sub-50ms TLS handshakes via QUIC resumption
* Line-speed request parsing with async runtime
* Built-in rate limiting and DoS protection
* Minimal CPU/memory overhead for containerized deployments

---

## 🧪 Status

* ⚙️ Language: Rust preferred (Zig prototype later)
* 🔐 TLS: QUIC + native certs + certless fallback w/ GhostID mutual auth
* 🌍 HTTP3: Enabled by default, HTTP/1.1 fallback optional
* 🧱 Planned: WASM module support, dynamic contract runner plugins

---

## Summary

QNGP isn’t just an NGINX replacement — it’s the evolution of web servers into programmable blockchain-aware gateways. Hosting, reverse proxying, identity, smart contracts, and dApp security converge here.

Ready for Web5.
