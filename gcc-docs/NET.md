. Communications Infrastructure (COMMS.md)

GhostNet is built with next-generation networking protocols to usher in a new era: Web5 — a convergence of Web2 familiarity, Web3 decentralization, and futuristic real-time cryptographic infrastructure.

Core Technologies

QUIC + WireGuard: Multiplexed, encrypted transport for GhostMesh

IPv6-Native Design: Modern routing with end-to-end addressability

ICE/STUN/TURN: Fallback traversal to ensure NAT-bypassing reliability

TLS/DoH/DoT: Secure DNS and certificate validation as first-class citizens

DNSSEC + ENS + Unstoppable Domains: Merging traditional and blockchain-based naming

Web2 to Web3 Bridge

Programmable identity login using GhostID

Chain-native TLS: certificate generation, renewal, and resolution via GhostChain

GhostDNS: Hybrid DNS server resolving blockchain-linked services with domain fallback

API and microservice gateways that settle payments on GhostChain or external chains

GhostVault: local programmable wallet that interacts with existing web auth patterns

Web5 Vision

Web5 is:

Cryptographic by Default

Programmable and Private

Resilient via Mesh and Edge Compute

Real-Time Transactional and Post-Quantum Ready

Capable of running on your router, phone, or datacenter

GhostNet’s networking layer is eco-friendly, ultra-fast (approaching HBAR-scale performance), and designed to treat networking infrastructure as a first-class participant in cryptographic consensus.

8. Governance & Tokenomics

GCC (Ghost Chain Credits): Primary transactional token

RLUSD: Stablecoin of choice (Ripple-backed or natively issued)

Proof of Contribution: Smart contracts measure and reward relay/storage

On-chain governance via GhostID

Weighted voting based on identity + contribution

9. Privacy and Security

All communication is end-to-end encrypted via WG + QUIC

Local key handling only via GhostVault

ZK rollups and selective disclosure for audits and compliance

Full offline support for transaction signing

10. Roadmap

Phase 1: Core Infra Stack

GhostVault prototype (Rust)

"gchain" CLI + daemon interface

Phase 2: Chain + Identity

GhostChain launch (testnet)

zkID, DNS, Certificate resolution

RPC + identity bridges (Ethereum, HBAR, Stellar)

Phase 3: Applications & Integration

Smart DNS (GhostDNS)

RLUSD integration

Microservice payments, AI inference API

Web2 site integration and programmable TLS/NGINX plugins

11. Conclusion

GhostNet merges the best of decentralized identity, programmable networking, and blockchain infrastructure into a single secure, incentivized, developer-friendly platform. It is not just a blockchain. It's a foundation for the next generation of internet-native infrastructure where identity, trust, and value are programmable and secured at the protocol level.
