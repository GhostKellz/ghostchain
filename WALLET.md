# GhostWallet Specification (WALLET.md)

## Overview

GhostWallet is the official digital identity and asset manager of GhostChain. More than a wallet, it’s your secure, recoverable, cross-device vault for interacting with Web5, GhostNet, and the decentralized web.

It combines the best aspects of crypto wallets, secure enclave tech, DID key management, and recovery-first design — reimagining what a wallet should be in the post-Web3 world.

## 🎯 Core Goals

* **Zero-friction onboarding** (passkey-style)
* **Secure, recoverable, and decentralized key management**
* **Support for fungible, non-fungible, and soulbound tokens**
* **Programmable identity and wallet policies**
* **Interoperability with Web2, Web3, and cDNS domains**

---

## 🔐 Key Features

### 🔑 Decentralized Identity Foundation

* Supports DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers)
* Linked to GhostID (soulbound, non-transferable ID)
* Public and private personas
* zkLogin and biometric integration

### 🧠 Smart Key Management

* Uses threshold cryptography (MPC / Shamir's Secret Sharing)
* Keys split across user devices, cloud vault, and recovery agents
* Optional hardware enclave support (TPM / Secure Enclave / YubiKey)
* Auto-rotation and time-locked key features

### 📲 Device & Agent Awareness

* GhostWallet agents can run locally or in GhostMesh
* Keys can be backed up to encrypted GhostVault shards
* Peer-to-peer key escrow for recovery

### 🪙 Asset Support

* SPIRIT, MANA, RLUSD, SOUL
* ERC20, Stellar, Hedera, Ripple compatible assets
* NFT and identity badge management

### 🤝 Interoperability

* WebAuthn / Passkey compatibility
* OIDC/OAuth bridging
* cDNS name resolution
* WalletConnect & GhostConnect for dApp linking

### 🌱 Recovery & Resilience

* Social recovery via GhostCircle
* Metadata and auth history stored with zkProofs
* Recovery policy programmable on-chain
* Dual-mode: Self-custodial or custodial fallback

---

## 🔄 Transaction Layer

* Fully QUIC/HTTP3 capable
* gRPC & WebSocket streaming for real-time updates
* zkValidated signing for privacy-preserving txs
* Multi-party approval workflows for enterprise / teams

---

## 🧰 Developer Support

* SDKs for Rust, Zig, TypeScript
* ghostctl CLI wallet module
* Built-in signer and verifier libraries
* gRPC APIs and GraphQL endpoints

---

## 🔭 Future Vision

* A wallet that lives across your devices, browser, and secure mesh
* Your Web5 passport: for payments, identity, voting, access, and ownership
* More than storing coins — it’s the backbone of your digital autonomy

---

## Next Steps

1. GhostVault key storage system finalization
2. Agent-based secure recovery prototype
3. WebAuthn & biometric enrollment interface
4. Wallet-to-GhostMesh encrypted tx channel
5. UI/UX design for mobile + terminal interfaces

---

GhostWallet is your bridge to Web5. Secure, programmable, and self-sovereign.
