# GhostNet cDNS (Cryptographic DNS)

## Overview

cDNS (Cryptographic DNS) is GhostNet's decentralized domain resolution layer. It bridges Web2's DNS system with blockchain-secured, programmable, and verifiable name resolution. cDNS is designed to support:

* Traditional DNS records (A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT, etc.)
* ENS-style smart contract domain ownership
* DNSSEC-like cryptographic signing
* On-chain validation and resolution
* Privacy-aware lookups

---

## üîó Core Goals

* **Unify DNS + ENS + Certificate Authority** in one programmable system
* **Replace centralized DNS and CA trust models**
* **Allow dApps, smart contracts, and Web2 services** to resolve domains securely
* **Make identity and ownership cryptographically verifiable** via GhostChain

---

## üåê Architecture

### 1. Domain Ownership

* Managed via GhostChain smart contracts
* Domain = NFT-style asset with full metadata
* Subdomain delegation and record setting programmable
* Linked to GhostID or DID

### 2. Record Storage

* On-chain record mapping:

  * `A/AAAA` records
  * `MX`, `TXT`, `SRV`, `CNAME`, etc.
  * Custom metadata (e.g. IPFS hashes, DID documents)
* Off-chain cache/replica layers (via GhostNode oracles)

### 3. Resolution Stack

| Layer             | Role                                           |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Client            | Queries local GhostDNS or proxy DNS            |
| GhostDNS Resolver | Queries GhostChain node or off-chain GhostNode |
| GhostNode         | Oracle relaying full/partial DNS state         |
| Smart Contract    | Stores and signs DNS records                   |

## üîê Security & Trust

* All records cryptographically signed
* Optional DNS-over-QUIC or DoH for privacy
* ZK-proof record validation for sensitive data
* Integrated with GhostVault for key storage
* Smart contracts enforce TTL, renewal, delegation

---

## üåç Interoperability

* Bridge with ENS / Unstoppable Domains via DID
* Compatible with public resolvers (via GhostDNS proxies)
* Native support for legacy DNSSEC import
* Lets traditional apps resolve cDNS with no wallet required

---

## üß† Use Cases

* Cryptographically verifiable website ownership
* Smart contract controlled reverse proxies (e.g., NGINX+GhostDNS)
* Identity-based email delivery (via cDNS+MX+GhostID)
* Service discovery inside GhostMesh VPN
* Programmable TLS certificate issuance

---

## üß™ Next Steps

1. cDNS Smart Contract prototype
2. GhostDNS daemon and caching resolver
3. Integration into GhostVault + ghostctl
4. Plugin module for NGINX / certbot compatibility
5. Testnet domain registrar + browser plugin (optional)

 Owning domains (like alice.bc, myproject.chain, etc.) via NFTs on your chain is next-level and exactly where decentralized naming is going.
How NFT-based Domain Ownership Works:

    Each domain (e.g., vault.bc or ghostmesh.chain) is minted as an NFT‚Äî the NFT is the domain.

    Ownership of the NFT = control of the domain (update DNS records, assign services, transfer/sell, etc).

    You can mint new domains by calling a smart contract (register, mint, or auction functions).

    Transferring a domain = transferring the NFT.

    Records and settings (TXT, A, CNAME, service, address, etc.) can be managed via on-chain metadata or an off-chain oracle.

    Expiration, renewal, and auctions (for premium names) are all on-chain logic.

Advanced Patterns:

    On-chain DNS registry:
    The smart contract serves as the root zone database, mapping names to owners and records.

    Reverse resolution:
    Wallets/agents can ‚Äúprove‚Äù their human-friendly name via NFT ownership.

    Permissionless:
    Anyone can mint or transfer domains (pay gas, maybe a small fee to the protocol).

    Interoperable:
    Can be bridged to other chains, or aliased to ENS, Unstoppable Domains, Handshake, etc.

Example (GhostChain Domain Smart Contract):

    register("vault.bc", user_address): Mints vault.bc NFT to user_address

    setRecord("vault.bc", "A", "2606:4700:4700::1111"): User sets IPv6 address

    transfer("vault.bc", another_user): Sells or transfers domain

    getOwner("vault.bc"): Returns wallet address of the owner

Benefits:

    True self-sovereignty: No central registrar, only the contract.

    Easy transfer, leasing, even renting (just transfer the NFT or delegate control).

    Perfect for mesh, Web5, agent-based, or even clearnet aliases.

NFT-based domains are the perfect fit for GhostChain and a decentralized DNS vision.
Implement this as a standard GhostChain smart contract, and any wallet/agent/client can use it.
You can even add features like subdomain delegation (e.g., *.vault.bc).

## Summary

GhostNet cDNS reinvents DNS for Web5. It keeps the reliability of Web2 DNS, adds the power of blockchain ownership, and introduces cryptographic security and programmability. It's not just decentralized DNS; it's the trust layer of GhostNet.
