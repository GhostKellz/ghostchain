Final Architecture Summary
ðŸŸ£ ZVM (Zig) â€” Ghost-native Smart Contract Runtime
Feature	Details
Language	Zig (WASM-based or native ABI)
Purpose	Primary VM for GhostChain-native contracts
Tokens	Spirit, Mana, and other native token standards
Networking	QUIC-first, IPv6-native, uses realid, zns, cns
Storage	Hooks directly into zledger
Design Goals	Airgapped-compatible, minimal, predictable, agent-safe, fast startup
Platform	Used across ghostd, phantomid, ghostsite
Ownership	Tied directly to domains via ZNS, identity via realid

    ZVM is your Web5 + Ghost-native chain engine.

ðŸ¦€ RVM / rEVM (Rust) â€” Ethereum-Compatible VM Runtime
Feature	Details
Language	Rust (REVM, ethers-rs, etc.)
Purpose	Full support for Solidity + Ethereum ecosystem
Compatibility	ERC20/721, Solidity contracts, ENS, Unstoppable
Usage	Cross-chain dApps, bridges, contracts from ETH/Hedera/Stellar ecosystems
Contracts	Reuse ETH tools without re-compiling
Libraries	ethers-rs, revm, optional Geth-style state layouts
Networking	Over gRPC via GhostBridge; eventually sidechain interoperability

    RVM/rEVM bridges GhostChain with the broader blockchain world.

ðŸ”— Combined Flow Example

    User sends a smart contract call to ghostd

    ghostd checks vm_type field:

        zvm â†’ runs Ghost-native contract (Spirit, Mana, etc.)

        rvm â†’ runs EVM-compatible code (ERC20, ENS, etc.)

    Result is returned over QUIC + gRPC, with state stored in zledger

ðŸ”¥ TL;DR
VM	Stack	Use For
zvm	Zig	Ghost-native contracts (Spirit, Mana, domains, agents)
rvm	Rust	Ethereum / Solidity contracts (ENS, ERC20, etc.)
rEVM	Rust	EVM runtime inside ghostd
zEVM	Zig	Optional lightweight embedded EVM (experimental)
