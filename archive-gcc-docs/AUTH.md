# GhostNet Identity & Authentication (OIDC, OAuth2, and Beyond)

## Overview

GhostNet requires a modern, secure, **zero-trust**, and **recoverable** identity system that:

* Is cryptographically verifiable
* Avoids reliance on Web2-style OAuth/OIDC identity silos
* Supports recovery, multi-device presence, and delegated trust

This document explores the technologies available today, compares them, and outlines how GhostNet will approach identity.

## ‚úÖ Legacy Options

### üîë OAuth2 + OpenID Connect (OIDC)

* **Pros:**

  * Ubiquitous in Web2 (Google, Entra, GitHub)
  * Easy SSO integration
  * Good for importing trust/reputation
* **Cons:**

  * Centralized identity providers
  * No built-in cryptographic proofs
  * Poor recoverability without provider access

**GhostNet usage:** Optional integration for federation or linking external accounts to GhostID

## üîê Modern Identity Tech

### üßæ Verifiable Credentials (VCs)

* **W3C standard for signed identity claims**
* Works across systems and domains
* Useful for KYC, social attestations, and org credentials
* Can be anchored to blockchain (e.g. GhostChain)

### üß¨ Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)

* Self-sovereign identity primitives
* Can be resolved via blockchain, DNS, IPNS, etc.
* Compatible with Verifiable Credentials

**GhostNet usage:** DIDs serve as the base identifier for each user/node/device

### üß† zkID (ZK-Proof Identity)

* Zero-Knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving identity
* Proves properties ("over 18", "is contributor", etc.) without revealing identity
* Ideal for anonymous governance, eligibility proofs, and selective disclosure

### üîÑ Cryptographic Recovery Paths

* Social recovery with threshold signatures (Shamir, FROST)
* Delegated device recovery
* Biometric fallback (encrypted locally)
* Time-locked key rotation via smart contracts

## üîí GhostNet Identity Architecture

| Layer           | Tech                 | Purpose                                 |
| --------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Device Identity | Ed25519 / ECDSA      | Local keypair tied to GhostVault        |
| Global Identity | DID + zkProof trail  | Public GhostID identity                 |
| Auth Protocols  | OIDC / OAuth2 bridge | Interop with Web2 / Federation          |
| Recovery        | Threshold Sig + zk   | Key loss protection / multi-device sync |
| SSO Layer       | GhostSSO             | Works across dApps and Web2 apps        |

## üîÆ Future Features

* DIDComm-style encrypted messaging between nodes
* Reputation-based attestations and trust scores
* zk-ID + dApp SSO for voting, role-based access
* Integration with GhostVault Agents for behavior-aware trust

---

## Summary

GhostNet will leverage:

* DID + zkProofs for core identity
* Optional OIDC/OAuth2 as bridges
* Cryptographic, privacy-preserving recoverability
* Agent-powered audit, SSO, and monitoring

This redefines how identities are issued, recovered, and trusted ‚Äî without centralized servers, email resets, or wallet phrases.
