# GhostChain Tokenomics Overview

## üåê Overview

GhostChain is a modern cryptographic infrastructure built for the next evolution of the web‚Äî**Web5**‚Äîbridging Web2 and Web3 with programmable identity, secure networking, and real-world incentive layers. Its native token ecosystem is designed to reflect contribution, energy, and verifiable trust.

## ü™ô Tokens and Their Roles

### 1. **SPIRIT (SPR)** ‚Äî *The Core Fuel*

* **Type:** Fungible token (primary gas token)
* **Purpose:** Used for smart contract execution, gRPC service payments, DNS/QUIC certificate provisioning, GhostMesh relay operations.
* **Symbol:** `SPR`
* **Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000 (initially capped, governance-expandable)
* **Use Cases:**

  * Pay for transactions on GhostChain
  * Stake for mesh routing priority and compute access
  * Incentivize infrastructure contributions

---

### 2. **MANA (MNA)** ‚Äî *Contributed Energy*

* **Type:** Earned token (non-minted)
* **Purpose:** Tracks proof of contribution (bandwidth, AI agent uptime, compute cycles)
* **Symbol:** `MNA`
* **Supply:** Dynamic, earned via system metrics and verified via zk-proofs
* **Use Cases:**

  * Governance weight multiplier
  * Access to special features (zero-fee access, smart DNS, AI hosting rewards)
  * Tradable to SPR via internal GhostVault oracles

---

### 3. **RLUSD** ‚Äî *Real World Stablecoin*

* **Type:** Stablecoin (Ripple-backed or native pegged)
* **Purpose:** Used for off-chain commerce, microtransactions, web service hosting, dApp payments
* **Symbol:** `RLUSD`
* **Peg:** 1:1 USD equivalent
* **Use Cases:**

  * Pay for services on GhostNet or externally
  * Seamless interaction with ETH, XRP, HBAR via wrapped bridges

---

### 4. **SOUL (Non-Transferable)** ‚Äî *Identity Proof*

* **Type:** SBT (SoulBound Token)
* **Purpose:** Identity verification and zero-trust credentials
* **Use Cases:**

  * Authenticate to services (GhostID)
  * Sign critical operations (vaults, contracts)
  * Weight governance proposals securely

---

## üîÑ Interoperability

* GhostChain will support wrapped tokens via bridges:

  * **wETH, wHBAR, wXRP, wBTC** accepted in GhostVaults
  * zk-based proof conversion for privacy
* **ENS + GhostDNS**: Interoperable identity and DNS resolution across L1 and GhostChain

---

## üîê Governance

* Voting powered by:

  * **SOUL** (Identity weight)
  * **SPR** (Stake weight)
  * **MANA** (Contribution multiplier)
* Snapshot + on-chain proposals
* ZK-verifiable participation with audit trails
