# IDENTITY.md — GhostID & Soulbound Identity

## 🧠 Overview

GhostID is the identity layer for GhostNet — a next-generation, soulbound, cryptographically secure identity system built to interface across Web2, Web3, and Web5 ecosystems.

GhostID replaces traditional wallets and login systems with persistent, programmable identity constructs. These identities are portable, zero-trust, encrypted, and optionally soulbound (non-transferable).

## 🔐 Core Concepts

### 🔑 RLID (Real ID)

* Soulbound, cryptographically anchored identity
* Used to sign smart contracts, authenticate dApps, verify assets
* Optionally tied to biometrics, passkeys, and/or hardware enclave

### 🌐 QID (QUIC ID)

* Peer-specific, ephemeral or persistent networking identity
* Used for wide-area mesh (GhostMesh), P2P payments, secure tunnels
* DNS-integrated: QID can be published as a cDNS TXT record

### 🔄 GhostID Modes

* **Public ID**: Shareable, resolvable identity (like ENS/UD)
* **Private ID**: Encrypted, hidden, used for wallet recovery and secure operations
* **Dual Mode**: Allows public-facing profile with private signing identity behind

## 📦 Features

* Fully local (optional cloud fallback via GhostVault)
* Recoverable identity via trusted mesh (no 12-word seed phrase!)
* Supports OIDC, OAuth2, passkeys, FIDO2, hardware tokens
* ID signing occurs via gRPC over QUIC or WireGuard/QUIC hybrid
* Optionally soulbound to prevent trading/sale of identity

---

## 📁 Use Cases

* ✅ Signing & submitting smart contracts
* ✅ Gating access to private dApps or VPN endpoints
* ✅ Attesting to ownership or trust (on-chain KYC-like functionality)
* ✅ Replacing TLS certs, SSH keys, 2FA codes
* ✅ Auditable trail for regulatory compliance, verified contributions

## 🔄 Identity Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: User generates GhostID (local or delegated)
2. **Binding**: Tied to keypair, optionally biometrics or passkeys
3. **Publication**: DNS or GhostVault anchor (optional)
4. **Use**: Signs contracts, verifies dApps, issues credentials
5. **Recovery**: Rehydration via encrypted backup or GhostMesh quorum

---

## 🔭 Interoperability

* Integrates with:

  * ENS / Unstoppable Domains
  * OIDC-based login (Google, GitHub, Microsoft)
  * DNSSEC + GhostDNS for publishing & resolution
  * WalletConnect v3 compatibility

---

## 🔮 Future Vision

GhostID becomes your programmable digital passport:

* Tied into GhostChain's staking, voting, and oracle systems
* Required to launch nodes, create assets, issue credentials
* Can prove human identity without revealing personal data (zkProofs)

---

## Summary

GhostID bridges identity between blockchain, traditional web, and the evolving Web5 stack — all while ensuring privacy, recoverability, and soulbound security. It is the cornerstone for all access, signing, and accountability within the GhostChain and GhostNet ecosystem.
